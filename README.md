# Two Point Conversion Decision Tool
  By Vibhu Krishnan
  
  Many coaches struggle with the decision to go for it on a two point conversion. In today's NFl, most coaches only go for two when they are desperate need for points.     After conducting research and creatibng this tool, I have discovered many scenarios where it is advantegous to go for two as early as the 4th quarter. Using previous     years of NFL play by play data, I have created a tool that will output win probabilities given a certain situation and inform a coach or fan if the best decision is to   kick an extra point or go for two after scoring a touchdown.
